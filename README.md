# Thyroid_Diff_Classification_Model
This repository contains python code for different classification models that are trained on the "Thyroid_Diff.csv" dataset.
The Dataset includes 17 features.
Input Features : Age, Gender, Smoking ......., Stage, Response
Target : Recurred
The models are trained using different classification algorithms
STEPS:
- Import the libraries
- Load the Dataset
- Split the dataset into input features and target
- Encode the columns which include categorical data
- Split the Dataset into Training and Test Set
- Apply the Model
- Predict the test results
- Use Hyper Parameter Tuning to get the Best Model with Best Features
- Generate the Classification Report and Find the Evaluation Metrics for each model
